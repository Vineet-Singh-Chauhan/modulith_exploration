# Exploring Events In Spring Modulith 

In our last article, we discussed the basics of spring modulith and at this point we know that spring modulith does not magically turns our monolith into a modular monolith but instead provide a set of tests that help us to track places where we violate the modular design patterns and provide a set of tools that help us to reduce coupling and increase cohesion in our application, And one such tool is - Events.

But before we dive straight into events lets first complete a few basic concepts that we did not cover in our last article, this will help us to harden our foundation and have a quick refresher through our last position on code.

# Left over topics:
0. Named Interfaces
1. Open Application Modules
2. Defining Explicit Application Module Dependencies
3. Customizing Module Detection Strategy
4. Customizing Named Interface Detection

So, before diving into the article, I have refactored the code to have proper exceptions and a generic exception.
Also, services has been replaced by interfaces and their implementation has been moved to internal packages. We made all classes except the service interfaces as package private to adhere to intended architecture
